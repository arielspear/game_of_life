# pdx.rb Monthly Exercise (Javascript)

## Initializing the Exercise

To get things started, get npm installed on your machine however you see fit.
Once ruby is installed, running `. bin/setup` (Note: `.` as a command will run
files that don't have executable permissions)

After that you should be able to run tests via `npm test` and you're good to go!
